        <p>The Clonturk Communist Party was founded on the 28th of February by Ashley. It quickly expanded to include more than
          about 3ish members and launched its Student Council Election Campaign. The purpose of this website is to inform people about
          our party and advertise our campaign. Our founder Ashley will be running for 3rd year student council in the Winter of 2024.
          If you wish to run for your year, you can contact us and we will help you in any way you may need.

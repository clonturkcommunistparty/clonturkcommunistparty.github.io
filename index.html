      <h1 class="heading">Welcome, Communists.</h1>
      <p>
        We are the Clonturk Communist Party. We are a political party of third
        years focused on bringing Communism to Clonturk. We believe that every
        student should become a Communist and we hope that we can bring change to this 
        school through compassion, ambition, and of course, propaganda. If this sounds 
        like something you might
          be interested in, see the <a href="getinvolved.html">Get Involved</a> page to 
          learn more.

        The Clonturk Communist Party was founded on the 28th of February 2024, when Ashley had an idea to bring Communism to Clonturk.
        Since then, it has grown to include over like a few members, striving to bring Communism to the school we all know and love.
        One of our secondary missions is to spread awareness about Communism, what it means, and how <i><b>you</b></i> can make a difference.
